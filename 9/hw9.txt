HW log:

First I used the command git checkout v3.0 -b quote to create a new branch 
called quote.

I installed the patch using the command patch -p0 < quote-3.0-patch.txt

I reviewed how to use change buffer and then edited the change log by just
opening emacs, typing in the command C-x 4 a and then entering the changes I
 made.

I committed the changes I made using the command: 
git commit -aF ChangeLog

I then generated the patch using the command:
git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

The next step was verifying whether my partner's patch worked.

My partner was Nikhil, who emailed me his formatted-patch.txt. I first created 
a new 3.0 branch called "partner" using the command:
git checkout -b 'partner' 'v3.0'

Then I used:
git am NIKSformatted-patch.txt and got
Applying: 2017-12-03 Nikhil Swaminathan <nikhil@lnxsrv01.seas.ucla.edu> and I 
found that the patch was successful.

Then I built using the commands given in the lab and ran
./src/diff . - and ./src/diff --help 

No ` found, so it works.

I then verified the ChangeLog using make distdir. After running for a while, it
 creates diffutils-3.0.1-c190. The first entry is the right change log entry:

        2017-12-03 Nikhil Swaminathan <nikhil@lnxsrv01.seas.ucla.edu>
                * src/cmp.c: Changing all of the "`" to "'" and """
                * src/diff.c: Changing all of the "`" to "'" and """
                * src/diff3.c: Changing all of the "`" to "'" and """
                * src/dir.c: Changing all of the "`" to "'" and """
                * src/sdiff.c: Changing all of the "`" to "'" and """
                * src/util.c: Changing all of the "`" to "'" and """
So it works.

The last part was finding the newest merge that is not newer than 2015-01-25.
I did this using the command cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs followed by gitk, which
opened up the xquartz window. I took a screenshot and wrote the description 
accordingly.
