Lab Report

I started by cloning the diffutils repository by running the command:
git clone ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils

I then typed in git log command followed by the git tag command and copied
their respective code into the files git-log.txt and git-tags.txt respectively.

I found the commit entitled “maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not
`like this'” by searching for it in the git-log.txt using the emacs search
command. I then copied it into the quote-patch.txt by copying the commit ID and
then using the command git show 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f >
quote patch.txt.

I then checked out version 3.0 by using the command checkout 'v3.0' -b 'my3.0'.

I used the patch command to apply quote-patch.txt and skipped past the cases
which could not be patched. I got the following output from the patch.

can't find file to patch at input line 35
Perhaps you used the wrong -p or --strip option?

|    maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this'
|    
|    This is in response to a recent change in the GNU coding standards,
|    which now suggest quoting 'like this' or "like this", instead of
|    `like this' or ``like this''.

I then used git status to get an overview of what happened and got the
following output.

The next stage was opening each of the modified files in emacs and using vc-diff,
vc-revert and diff-apply-hunk. For all the files without a .c extension I just
opened them and used vc-diff and vc-revert to make them back to normal. For the
files with .c extensions I used vc-diff and then only specifically removed the
commands by undoing each using diff-apply-hunk prefixed with C-u. I also looked at
 the rejected patch files which were diff.c.rej and diff3.c.rej and I edited out
 their `s for 's.

I then removed all the untracked files using git clean -f and I got the following
output.

I seem to have two extra files that exist because there are some processes
running on my computer that I can't get rid off.

Then I used the command git diff > quote-3.0-patch.txt to put the patch, which
was 341 lines long into the required file.

I then followed the steps given in README hacking to build the modified version
of diffutils. I used the command ./bootstrap and then built the necessary patch
given in the spec and then ran ./configure, make and make check.

I tested it with diff . - and diff --help and received the correct output when
` was replaced with '.

The last step was to do a sanity check and compared the old version with our
modified version. I created the two directories diffutils-3.0 and
diffutils03.0-patch and the used the command:
git clone ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils diffutils-3.0-orig to clone the code into
a folder called diffutils-3.0-orig. I then copied the patched sources codes to
diffutils-3.0-patch and the original code to diffutils-3.0. I used the patched
diff to put the comparison in a text file called quote-3.0-test.txt using the
command given in the spec. I compared the quote-3.0-test.txt and
quote-3.0-patch.txt using the diff command and found that there were quite a lot
of differences but every difference is innocuous.
